Hi, I'm Emily! I am studying data science at UC San Diego. My interests lie in utilizing big data in clinical research and healthcare spaces. 
In my free time, I enjoy doing calligraphy and video editing. I am always learning new things; currently I am exploring balloon art and electric bike conversion. I would love to get to know you, so feel free to shoot me a message!
