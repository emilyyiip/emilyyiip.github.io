Hi, I'm Emily! I am studying data science at UC San Diego. My interests lie in utilizing data to advance in clinical research and improve healthcare spaces. 
In my free time, I enjoy doing calligraphy and video editing, but I am always taking up new hobbies. I would love to get to know you, so feel free to shoot me a message!
